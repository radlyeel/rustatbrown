Note that this is the fixnumth (https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/)time I've started 
down this path, but maybe this time I'll reach the tippng point.

I will be going slower, manually typing in all the code for two reasons:
  - copy/paste only verifies that my toolchain is working.
  - this is not a race.  As I learned from my nephew James, it's about the journey,
    not the destination.

One side effect is that the look-and-feel (including comments, variable names, and whitespace)
space will differ from The Book.

I will be skipping the Hello World section; this being my fixnumth time, that would
not be time well spent.

Note that in VSCode, When the editor is in main.rs, a Run arrow icon appears just above
'fn main()'that appears to be almost like 'cargo run'

VSCode does not seem to auto-indent.
